## The Pulse of Berlin

A few days ago, I started experimenting with Foursquare’s API to explore Berlin’s neighborhoods and its dynamic life and to capture the pulse of the city.

I used Foursquare’s trending functionality to retrieve trending venues for the whole city over the course of 5 days in April.

We can see Berlin’s pulse in the animation below, with lots of activity during the day and relative quiet during the night.
